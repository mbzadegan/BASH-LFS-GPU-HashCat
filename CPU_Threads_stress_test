# A common way to simulate a challenging process is by performing computationally intensive tasks, such as mathematical calculations or cryptographic operations, in parallel.
# Below is an example script that spawns a CPU-intensive process on each thread using a for loop and background processes:


# Get the number of CPU threads
NUM_THREADS=$(nproc)

echo "Utilizing $NUM_THREADS CPU threads..."

# Function to simulate a CPU-intensive task
cpu_intensive_task() {
  while true; do
    # Perform heavy floating-point operations
    echo "scale=5000; a(1)*4" | bc -l > /dev/null
  done
}

# Launch a process for each thread
for ((i=1; i<=NUM_THREADS; i++)); do
  cpu_intensive_task &
done

# Wait for all background processes (if needed)
wait
